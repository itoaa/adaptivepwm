# AdaptivePWM CLI Requirements
# ============================
#
# Core dependencies for the CLI tool
#

# No external dependencies required for basic functionality
# The CLI uses only Python standard library modules:
# - argparse for command-line parsing
# - json for configuration handling
# - os for file operations
# - sys for system interactions
# - datetime for timestamps
# - typing for type hints

# For extended functionality (optional):
# - pyOpenSSL (for real PKI operations)
# - requests (for remote API communication)
# - cryptography (for advanced crypto operations)
